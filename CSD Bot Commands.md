## We have a custom bot in our Discord Server!
This bot is used for logging information for our Internal Security Department, and making embeds to announce shifts when they are hosted.

## Bot Commands
Please run the **`csd!help`** command to view a list of our commands and what they do.
**NOTE: The bot is only turned on when it is in use, so any commands you use when it is offline will not work.**

### Important Links & Information
Feel free to create an [Issue](https://github.com/NosadfacesRBLX/csdrblx/issues/5) if you run into any errors with the bot.
> DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE IF THE BOT DOESN'T RESPOND AS IT MAY BE OFFLINE
> However, if the bot is online and not responding, then you may do so.
