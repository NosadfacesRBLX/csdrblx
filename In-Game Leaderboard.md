## New leaderboard in-game!
This leaderboard has many features, including some mobile support! There are some terms you should know, which will now be listed.

`Sidebar` = The player leaderboard near the top right of the screen.

`Sidebar Name` = The text displayed as the username for a player on the `Sidebar`.

`Player GUI` = A GUI popup that appears when a `Sidebar Name` is clicked on, it displays the users `Display Name`, `User Tag`, `Avatar & Avatar Search`,and `User ID / Account Age`.

`Avatar & Avatar Search` = A small icon of the users avatar, and a search icon that allows you to see what they are wearing currently.

`Display Name` = The text above the `User Tag`, which is what you should call said user by.

`User Tag` = The text below the `Display Name`, in case you want to know what a players username is, but it is hidden by their `Display Name`, the `User Tag` will show you their username. Usually it appears as `@(username)`.


Mobile players are not able to hide the `Sidebar`, however the `Player GUI` is supported on mobile.

### What if a players name shows up as [REDACTED]?
 `Sidebar Name`s that appear as [REDACTED] are only given to [REDACTED] Faculty, or HRs. Their `Display Name`, `User Tag`, and `User ID`, will all be hidden to prevent username leaking, as well as their `Avatar` image, `Search Button`, Add Friend, and Block features will be disabled.
 
### Can I have a custom Display Name / Sidebar Name?
Yes, but those are restricted strictly to [Sponsors](https://www.campsunnydaysrblx.com/sponsor) & Discord Server Boosters. However, certain staff members may get these for free as apart of their job like [REDACTED], Researchers, HRs, and Combatives.

### Why can't I see the avatar, avatar search, add friend, or block button on some peoples player GUIs?
HRs add friend features are automatically disabled to prevent spam friend requests, and certain features like blocking players, and the avatar search button may be turned on/off by their request.
