# We have a new commenting system on the CSD Website!
We now use Disqus on our blog pages for our new commenting system. It includes an automatic moderation system to flag, report, and delete comments, as well as a moderator badge for our HRs.

### What's new?
This will prevent staff impersonation, mainly due to the all new **CSD Website Moderator** tag that appears next to [Command Tier 3+](https://github.com/NosadfacesRBLX/csdrblx/blob/updates/command%20tiers.md#command-tier-3) members. You may also sign into an account if you do not have one, it also offers reactions to the post so we know how you can feel without having to go into detail!

#### We hope you enjoy the new system!
