# Now introducing Command Tiers!
The Command Tiers update lets you know who should be contacted to from first to last when talking to them about abuse or questions about rules.

## What are the command tiers?
### Command Tier 4
Command Tier 4 is strictly only given to those ranked Executive+.
**Do not contact this rank for abuse or rule related questions unless you have gotten permission from a Tier 3 member.**

### Command Tier 3
Command Tier 3 is given to those that are Department Supervisors, Department Heads, and even RAISA / ISD.
Only contact them if tier 2 or below cannot help you.

### Command Tier 2
Command Tier 2 is given to [REDACTED], but must be ranked Departmental Member+.
Only contact them if tier 1 cannot help, or the abuse or rules broken is too major to be handled by tier 1.

### Command Tier 1
Command tier 1 is given to members of the Ethics Committee, they should be contacted first before anyone else regarding abuse or rule breakers.
