## In-Game Logging
We can now log what a player does in-game and how long they are in game for!

### What do we log in-game?
We log who joins and leaves the game, and if you are a staff member, we log how long you have been in-game once you leave the server. We also log the restocks / refills that transporters do on-site, as well as request for certain staff members to do certain things. The control room status system is now logged and alerts RCU when a breach is happening. We can also log every time a server is shutdown due to an update.

### What do we use this data for?
This data is used for the weekly staff quota check , in-game activity, and shows us who is eligible for promotion or in some cases who to demote. This can also stop abusers from spamming the controls since we have their usernames and what they do logged each time they do something.
